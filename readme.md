__TRADE NOTIFIER__

This is just a simple way to get notified whenever someone sends you a trade on ROBLOX, as well as providing some details about it.

If you're a new trader and want friends to be able to see your trades and give feedback, or you just want to see your trades from discord, this is a suitable option.

All you need to do is edit config.json, putting in your:

- cookie
- Desired webhook URL
- Your Discord ID, so that the webhook may ping you with each trade.
