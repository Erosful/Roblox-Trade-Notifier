# TRADE NOTIFIER
## Information
This is just a simple way to get notified whenever someone sends you a trade on ROBLOX, as well as providing some details about it.

If you're a new trader and want friends to be able to see your trades and give feedback, or you just want to see your trades from discord, then this is a suitable option.

## Setup

Fork this github repo and edit config.json, putting in your:

- ROBLOX cookie
- Webhook URL
- Your Discord ID, so that the webhook may ping you with each trade.

## Credits

- This projects uses the [Rolimons](https://www.rolimons.com/) API to calculate projected flags and values.
- Direct all concerns or hate speech to Charles#4743
